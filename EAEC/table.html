      <td>The food we eat can have a significant impact on the environment. For example, meat and dairy products require a lot of land, water and energy to produce. They also create a lot of methane, a greenhouse gas. What`s more, food shipped from overseas uses a lot more resources than local produce. By eating fewer animal products, especially red meat, (or choosing a plant-based diet) and shopping for locally sourced food, you can make a big difference.  Why not support your local farmers` market?</td>
      <td>It`s never been easier to collaborate with others online. Whether through sharing documents using cloud storage or video conferencing instead of travelling, you can reduce your waste and emissions. Try moving away from printed documents where possible, and encourage others to work on their digital skills for the workplace.</td>
      <td>Single-use plastics may be convenient, yet they`re fairly dreadful for the environment. Not only do they pollute our waterways and oceans, but they also require energy to produce and recycle. You can stop using things like disposable coffee cups and cutlery to reduce your company`s carbon footprint.</td>
      <td>Composting is surprisingly good for the environment, particularly when food waste is such a big issue. By setting up a composting scheme at your school, you can help to reduce landfill methane emissions. What`s more, this type of compost is free, doesn`t use energy to produce, and is good for your school gardens.</td>
